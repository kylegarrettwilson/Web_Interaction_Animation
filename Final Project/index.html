                    Welcome to Smile Black, an audio-visual project by a self proclaimed audiophile. My name is Kyle
                    Wilson and I have loved music my entire life. My musical journey began at a young age with the
                    piano and progressed through the entire band classroom until I landed on percussion, the drum kit
                    to be more exact. Drumming has been my passion for nearly twenty years and I strive to progress
                    in this art every day. About a year ago I moved to Portland, Oregon to try and make drumming my
                    career. Just like they always say, the life of a working musician is not glamorous. After a couple
                    gigs with a few bands, I decided to create this YouTube project in hopes of showing the world
                    what my sound is. I hope you enjoy and subscribe if you do.

                    Kyle.
